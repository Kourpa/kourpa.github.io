    <b>Specifications</b> <br>
    Your program word cloud program should be able to take both a line of text
    and a path to a text file to generate a word cloud.  The parser in your inner
    libraries should try not to include words useless to word clouds
    (like articles [a, an, the], or minor words like "it", "us", "them");
    this is just notional since this is a programming example just show the
    principle of the filtering. As an output your program, and therefore the inner
    libraries, need to support the ability to return the word cloud sorted by counts
    with a min/max threshold option and it needs to be able to return the word cloud
    alphabetically with the ability to choose the starting characters.  For example,
    one run may ask for all words that occur more than 10 times but less than 20, and
    another may ask for the top ten words.  Another run may ask for all words alphabetically
    that start with the phrase "sa".  Have a driver program as well as unit tests that
    stimulate the library and the code with reasonable test cases.
